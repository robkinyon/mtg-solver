# mtg-solver in Ruby

This is the version that I used to spec out the code and figure out
the work. It's definitely not performant enough to run on my S20+.

## Development

* `rspec` to run the tests
* `./test.rb` to run a thing

## Release

* No release process (yet)

## Maintenance

* No maintenance process (yet)
